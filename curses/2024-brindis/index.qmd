## R en Red: ARcenso, Opportunities, and Community

On **December 20, 2024**, I participated as a speaker at the event **R en Red: ARcenso, Opportunities, and Community**, a meetup organized by **R-Ladies Buenos Aires** and **R en Buenos Aires**. The aim of this space was to share experiences, strengthen networks, and showcase collaborative projects based on the use of R in the local context.

I was in charge of the **welcome presentation**, where I introduced the goals of the event, its structure, and the main themes that guided the session. Afterwards, members of the team presented their contributions related to data from the Argentine Census, tools from the R ecosystem, and community-building experiences.

You can explore the welcome presentation at the following link (or view it directly below):
