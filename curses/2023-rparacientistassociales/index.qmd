Throughout this session, we will explore the use of R in the social sciences. No prior experience in programming or data analysis is required, as this workshop is designed for everyone ‚Äî from complete beginners to those with some background.

ü§î Why R? R is a programming language widely used in data science, statistics, and data analysis. In the social sciences, R can be an invaluable tool for exploring data, identifying patterns, and effectively communicating your findings ‚Äî regardless of your field of study.

You can access the repository here. We will be uploading course files and materials there.

‚û°Ô∏è This workshop is organized by the research project "The territorial fabric of social programs in Greater Buenos Aires: between the nation, municipalities, and social organizations (2015‚Äì2023)," based in the Department of Law and Political Science at the National University of La Matanza (UNLaM).
