> Explore health coverage in the City of Buenos Aires (CABA)

This dashboard was developed as the final project for the course **Introduction to the Processing, Analysis, and Interactive Visualization of Open Health Data**, part of the *Master’s in Statistical Information Generation and Analysis (UNTREF)*. It displays information on health coverage in the City of Buenos Aires (CABA) by **district (comuna), year, and sex**. The data was sourced from the [**Open Data Portal of the Government of Buenos Aires**](https://www.estadisticaciudad.gob.ar/eyc/?p=83857).
