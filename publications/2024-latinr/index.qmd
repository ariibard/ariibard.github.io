## Summary

The cost recovery process in the public health system of the City of Buenos Aires aims to recoup the expenses associated with providing healthcare services to patients who have health coverage but are treated within the public Progressive Care Network. The Operational Management Unit for Health Information and Statistics (GOGIES) has automated the generation of the necessary documentation for this process using **R** and open-source libraries. This has resulted in an immediate impact, saving work hours for those involved and contributing to a more efficient cost recovery process in the city.
