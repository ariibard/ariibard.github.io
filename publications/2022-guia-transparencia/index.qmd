## Summary

This document was collaboratively developed within the framework of the Transparency Commission of the Federal Council for Transparency, chaired by Argentinaâ€™s Access to Public Information Agency and composed of representatives from all 24 jurisdictions of the country. I contributed to its drafting as part of the Agency's technical team, alongside colleagues from various provinces and public institutions.

The **Federal Guide on Proactive Transparency** provides guidelines, recommendations, and best practices for designing and implementing proactive transparency policies from a **federal, context-sensitive, and sovereign perspective**. Its development was informed by experiences shared in the Councilâ€™s Working Sessions and aims to strengthen institutional capacities to ensure public access to information throughout the national territory.
