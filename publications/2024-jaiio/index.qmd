## Summary

Since 2016, the implementation of Health Information Systems (HIS) in the public subsystem of the City of Buenos Aires (CABA) has resulted in the production of large volumes of data. These data are essential for healthcare system management, research, and the dissemination of public information. One of the responsibilities of the Operational Management Unit for Health Information and Statistics (GOGIES) is the processing of data generated by HIS and the response to information requests submitted by various actors.

This article presents several strategies developed throughout 2023 to ensure the protection of personal and/or sensitive data in health information products. During that year, 586 requests for health data were received through the Help Desk â€” a platform used by the Ministry to manage information services and resolve issues. The article outlines the development of a classification and evaluation tool that categorizes the types of information requested, profiles of requesters, and intended use. It also describes the procedures applied to respond to requests involving sensitive and/or personally identifiable information.
