> *Dicen los Medios*: a dashboard that lets you explore what, how, and how much digital media talks about a given topic or issue.

This Shiny app was developed in collaboration with **Joaquín Lovizio Ramos** for the media observatory [Dicen los Medios](https://dicenlosmedios.com.ar/) at [Ateneo A.C](https://elateneo.org.ar/).

It’s a tool designed to **analyze the discourse of Argentinian digital media** based on keywords of your choice. With just a few clicks, you can generate visualizations to explore how different media outlets cover a topic. You can also create **word clouds** that summarize the key concepts related to your search.
