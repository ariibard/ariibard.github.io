I am a political scientist specialized in data science, with postgraduate training in statistics and technical experience in the analysis of social and health data. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistical Information Generation and Analysis (UNTREF) and a Specialization in Remote Sensing and GIS (UNLu).

My work combines the design and implementation of analytical solutions using R, Python, and SQL, applied to the processing of complex databases, automated reporting, and data visualization. I have developed interactive dashboards and Shiny applications, as well as text mining tools for media and public policy analysis.

I work as a data analyst at the Ministry of Health of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and as a university lecturer in text mining and social demography. I am also actively involved in research and science communication projects, and I coordinate initiatives such as the Núcleo de Innovación Social and *Dicen los Medios*.
