**I'm a political scientist specialized in data science**, with postgraduate training in statistics and technical experience in analyzing social and health data. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s degree in Statistical Information Generation and Analysis (UNTREF)** and a **Specialization in Remote Sensing and GIS (UNLu)**.

My work combines the design and implementation of analytical solutions using **R**, **Python**, and **SQL**, applied to complex data processing, report automation, and data visualization. Iâ€™ve developed interactive dashboards and **Shiny apps**, as well as **text mining tools** for media and public policy analysis.

I currently work as a **data analyst** at the *Ministry of Health of the City of Buenos Aires* and as a **university lecturer** in text mining and social demography.

Iâ€™m also actively involved in research and science communication projects, and I coordinate initiatives such as the [**Social Innovation Hub**](https://nucleodeinnovacionsocial.com.ar/) and [*Dicen los Medios*.](https://dicenlosmedios.com.ar/)

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a **co-organizer of [R en Buenos Aires](https://renbaires.github.io/)**, a community committed to sharing experiences, workshops, and knowledge about data science in R.
